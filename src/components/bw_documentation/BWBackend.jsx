The application relies on Entity Framework to manage database operations efficiently, providing seamless integration with SQL databases and enabling features like CRUD operations for books, bundles, user data and much more.</p>

User authentication is managed via secure cookies, ensuring privacy and session integrity. Role-based authorization divides access into two distinct roles: User and Admin. Regular users can browse and purchase books, while admins have additional privileges to manage products, bundles, and the structure of the website.</p>
